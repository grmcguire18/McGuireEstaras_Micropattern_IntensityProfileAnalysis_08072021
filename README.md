# McGuireEstaras_Micropattern_IntensityProfileAnalysis_08072021
- "A MATLAB code intended to analyze the RGB-Color intensity profiles of micropatterned gastruloid samples"
- Hello! This code was created for Dr. Conchi Estaras by Gillian R. McGuire in order to analyze micropatterned gastruloid samples for RGB-Color Intensity of three different markers (Brachury (pink), Sox17 (red), and Sox2 (green)).
- The code can be ran section be section or in its entirety.
- In general, this code will take the diamater of an image, use the improfile function to analyze the RGB color intensity, and then will save each profile (R, G, and B) plus x axis points into individual Excel sheets.
